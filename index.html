        <h3>My History</h3>

        <p>I've been playing minecraft ever since about 2014, I was around 4. I have played many hours of minecraft since then. With my microsoft account I made in 2020, it says I have played for 53 days and 13 or so hours. About 1285 hours of non-stop playing. It's 2025 right now for me.
        That doesn't include all the time before I had a microsoft account on the xbox 360 though.</p>
